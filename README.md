<h1 align="center">Important Information</h1>
<p align="center">This repo is for Create: Refabricated, a Fabric port of Create.</p>
<p align="center"><b>This project is not complete, and we do not recommend using it yet. You've been warned!</b></p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Important News:</b></h3>
<p align="center">We have decided to halt porting until the main project has dropped support for 1.15. Meanwhile, we will be working on separating some of the new Fabric-only code into its own library mod. When we resume porting, we will restart on a new branch using upstream's mappings (currently MCP) and port all files at once, changing as little as possible in those files. All of these decisions were made to maximize compatibility with upstream so that porting new commits is easier.</p>

Welcome to Create, a mod offering a variety of tools and blocks for Building, Decoration and Aesthetic Automation.

The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible, where item processing doesn't happen inside a single block with funny textures, it requires a set of actors working together in many possible arrangements.

Check out the wiki and in-game Tool-tips for further info on how to use these features, and stay tuned for an ever-growing selection of possibilities for Creative and Survival Minecraft.
